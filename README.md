# Android11PermissionsHandling


This codebase is realted to one weird flow in Android 11 permissions handling. 

In android 11 this is the weird flow-  permissions popups are dismissible, 
and when we dismiss we get callback like user selected never ask again :grin:

I wrote a blog on it where you check more about this problem and its workaround solution.
