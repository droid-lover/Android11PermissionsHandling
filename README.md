# Android11PermissionsHandling


This codebase is related to one weird flow in Android 11 permissions handling. 

In android 11 this is the weird flow-  permissions popups are dismissible, 
and when we dismiss we get callback like user selected never ask again :grin:

I also wrote a blog on it with solution, where you check more about this problem and its workaround solution.

also While requesting permissions there is slight difference please note that as well, than only you will get callback in ```onRequestPermissionsResult``` method.


in activity -

```ActivityCompat.shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale(requireActivity(), Manifest.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE)```


and in fragment -

```requestPermissions(arrayOf(Manifest.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE), READ_STORAGE_PERM)```

If we follow this way of requesting permissions based on Activity/Fragment it will surely give us the callback. #verified.
